Unity is always in 3D, even when switched to 2D.
The Z-position of sprites matters for rendering.
Sprites further from the camera get rendered first.

To avoid any problems with sprites becoming transparent or such place your sprite not on the background, but before it.
For example, camera would be on Z= -10, sprite at Z= -5 and background Z= 0. 
Alternatively keep the sprites where they are and move the background back.
